# Phase 5: Update Planning

Reconcile `docs/ai/planning/feature-{name}.md` with actual progress after completing any task.

If continuing from Phase 4, carry forward existing context. Otherwise ask for feature name, completed tasks, new tasks, blockers, planning doc path.

1. **Review** existing milestones, sequencing, dependencies, outstanding tasks.
2. **Reconcile** each task: mark status (done/in-progress/blocked/not started), note scope changes, record blockers, capture skipped or added tasks.
3. **Update** the planning doc with current status checklist (done, in-progress, blocked, newly discovered work).
4. **Suggest** next 2-3 actionable tasks, risky areas, coordination needed.
5. **Write summary** paragraph for the planning doc: progress, risks, upcoming focus, scope changes.

**Next**: If tasks remain → Phase 4 (Execute Plan). If all done → Phase 6 (Check Implementation).
