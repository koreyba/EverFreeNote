# Allure Agent Mode

Use Allure agent mode to design, review, validate, debug, and enrich tests in this project.

This file is project-specific guidance; the durable agent-mode, test-design, expectation, and evidence rules live in the `allure-agent-mode` skill. Before authoring or materially changing a test, invoke the `$allure-agent-mode` skill and read its `references/test-design.md` — do not author tests from general knowledge. If the skill is not installed, use this file plus the core non-negotiables below as the floor and keep conclusions conservative.

## Why Agent Mode

A test run is an instrument, not a pass/fail to scrape. Running tests through `allure agent` turns them into a reviewable account of what actually happened — steps, HTTP/SQL/browser evidence, attachments — plus automated findings about the tests themselves (for example, a test that ran with no assertions). State what the run should confirm with `--goal`; the report carries the goal and the evidence, so you, an upstream agent, or a human can validate it. The console gives a status; the agent output gives understanding and a critique.

Reach for agent mode through the loops in [Core Loops](#core-loops): run with a goal, make evidence checkable with expectations, triage failures and rerun just the failed tests, inspect CI results without local repro, and use a test as a debugging instrument. The run prints a summary digest to stdout (counts, findings, report link); read it, then open the agent output for depth (start at the output dir's `AGENTS.md` guide). Run `allure agent capabilities` to confirm the local surface. Reducing the run with `tail`/`grep`/`head` or `>/dev/null`, or stopping at the counts, throws away the findings and evidence — the agent output is the signal.

## Local Capability Snapshot

Refresh this section when Allure, test runners, Allure results paths, Allure report generation, CI, or project wrappers change. Confirm local support with the project wrapper, `allure --version`, `allure agent --help`, and `allure agent capabilities --json` before using optional commands. If existing-result or dump inspection is in scope, also confirm `allure agent inspect --help` before documenting inspect commands.

Do not store the exact Allure version here. Version output is a runtime fact; this file should store the wrapper, last snapshot marker, and how to refresh capabilities.

- Allure wrapper: `<fill during setup, e.g. yarn allure, npx allure, pnpm allure, ./gradlew allure>`
- Capability snapshot last checked: `<fill date, commit, or unknown>`
- Refresh capabilities with: `<wrapper> --version`, `<wrapper> agent --help`, and `<wrapper> agent capabilities --json`
- Agent execution: `<supported / limited / unsupported / unknown>`
- Output option: `<fill supported syntax or unknown>`
- HTML report mode: `<--report auto|off|awesome|config / unsupported / unknown>`
- Expectation controls: `<fill supported options, command goal controls, file format, or unknown>`
- Latest/state directory recovery: `<supported / unsupported / unknown>`
- Selection/rerun support: `<supported / unsupported / unknown>`
- Existing-result or dump inspection: `<supported syntax, e.g. agent inspect [results...] and --dump <archive>; unsupported; or unknown>`
- Existing-result fallback commands: `<generated agent-only config + allure generate / allure log / results pack-unpack / unsupported / unknown>`
- Capability/helper commands: `<capabilities/latest/query/select/state-dir support or unknown>`

- Allure results paths: `<fill during setup, e.g. <parent>/allure-results>`
- Known selector support: `<file/test name/label/package/suite/test plan/unknown>`
- Known environments or services needed for tests: `<fill during setup>`

## Allure Integrations

## Project Test-Design Conventions

Fill only project-specific conventions below. The durable test-design rules live in the `$allure-agent-mode` skill's `references/test-design.md` — load that skill before authoring, as the top of this file directs.

Core non-negotiables (the floor to follow when the skill is not loaded; full rules in the `$allure-agent-mode` skill's `references/test-design.md`):

- A new or changed regression test must fail for the intended bug before the fix and pass after; if reproducing the pre-fix failure is genuinely impossible, state why and what alternative evidence proves the fix.
- Do not weaken assertions, delete coverage, or skip, mute, or quarantine tests just to make a run pass; any such change needs explicit rationale.
- Keep tests boring and explicit — prefer readable, linear tests over loops, factories, or conditionals whose only value is saving a few repeated lines.
- Do not hide missing coverage behind runtime `if` branches, early returns, conditional test registration, or helper aliases; use the runner's explicit skip/xfail/quarantine with a stated reason.
- Steps, attachments, parameters, and labels must reflect real behavior from the current run, not filler.

- Accepted test layers: `<unit/component/integration/API/browser/CLI/etc. or unknown>`
- Preferred assertion style: `<framework matchers, custom assertions, deep-match messages, or unknown>`
- Parameterized test style: `<case naming, parameter reporting, limits, or unknown>`
- Boring-test preference: `<explicit tests over loops/factories/conditionals, shared business-step helpers, or unknown>`
- Smoke coverage conventions: `<higher-layer smoke expectations or unknown>`
- Mocking and integration-test preference: `<project rule or unknown>`
- Explicit skip/assumption mechanics: `<it.skip/it.skipIf/assumeThat/xfail/quarantine/setup failure convention or unknown>`
- Suppression/quarantine policy: `<owner/reason/issue/expiry/restore path or unknown>`

## Run Profiles

Document only profiles that exist in this project. If a profile is inferred rather than confirmed, mark it as inferred.
Use `allure agent` output defaults in command examples unless an explicit `--output` path is part of the project convention. Include framework result-directory environment variables only when the local adapter needs them and local evidence, installed help, official docs, or package README/source confirms the exact variable name.

| Profile | Command or profile intent | Expected use | Confidence limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| smoke | `<fill>` | Quick signal for critical paths | Does not prove full coverage |
| affected | `<fill>` | Changes mapped to likely tests | Mapping may miss indirect impact |
| feature/component | `<fill>` | Focused validation for one area | Depends on local labels/selectors |
| full | `<fill>` | Broad validation | Cost may be high |

## Execution Signal And CI Trust

Do not present ignored, excluded, swallowed, advisory, or non-gating test execution as proof that behavior is safe.

- Default local test command: `<fill or unknown>`
- Default local command exclusions: `<fill or unknown>`
- CI test jobs: `<fill names or unknown>`
- CI gating status: `<gating / non-gating / allowed failure / advisory / unknown>`
- Known ignored, skipped, muted, quarantined, or disabled tests: `<fill policy, owner, issue, restore path, or unknown>`
- Test artifacts retained by CI: `<raw Allure results, Allure dumps, agent output, generated reports, logs, traces, none, or unknown>`
- Local or CI results/dumps suitable for `allure agent inspect`: `<paths/artifact names, unsupported, or unknown>`

If CI or local execution is non-gating, excludes important tests, or swallows failures, call that out before using the run as proof.

Do not hide missing or unsupported coverage behind runtime `if` branches, early returns, conditional test registration, or helper aliases. Use the project's explicit skip, conditional-skip, assumption, xfail, quarantine, or setup-failure convention so the runner and Allure evidence show the reason.

## Local Expectation Controls

Before each validation run, decide whether expectations reduce a real risk for the intended conclusion. When they do, use the smallest fresh inline options supported by local `allure agent --help`.

- Supported expectation mechanism: `<inline CLI options / command goal controls / advanced file mode / unsupported / unknown>`
- Exact test/file/suite/label/profile support: `<fill or unknown>`
- Excluded-scope controls: `<supported / unsupported / unknown>`
- Evidence expectation controls: `<supported / unsupported / unknown>`
- Check/assertion step-name controls: `<supported / unsupported / unknown; fill useful substrings or naming convention>`
- Broad-audit fallback: `<fill local convention or unknown>`

Prefer inline options. Use `--expectations <file>` only as advanced mode when the contract is too large, generated, or policy-controlled.

When expectations are justified, they should state only the parts that matter for this run:

- what claim or validation depth the run is meant to support
- what should run
- what should not run
- which profile, environment, variant, or parameter set is intended
- what important checks or evidence should be visible through supported reporting or documented step-name conventions
- why this scope is enough
- what the run cannot prove

If local expectation support is unavailable or weak, run the narrowest practical command, review observed scope from manifests, and state that expectation checking was limited.

Treat the run goal as a claim boundary for review, not as proof. If the goal is wrong or stale, keep the runtime evidence and report what the observed run actually supports.

## Core Loops

### Test Review Loop

1. Identify the exact review scope and validation depth.
2. Create the smallest meaningful expectations using local supported controls when they protect the review conclusion.
3. Choose report mode by audience: `--report off` for iterative agent-only loops, and `--report auto`, `awesome`, or `config` for final user-reviewable runs.
4. Run only that scope through `allure agent`.
5. Print the run's `index.md` path.
6. For final runs with a generated HTML report, share the report link (see the report-link rule under Acceptance Rules).
7. Review `index.md`, `manifest/run.json`, `manifest/test-events.jsonl`, `manifest/tests.jsonl`, `manifest/findings.jsonl`, `manifest/expected.json` when the run used expectations, and relevant per-test markdown.
8. Inspect source code only after runtime evidence explains what executed.
9. Call out weak scope, weak evidence, execution-signal limits, or partial runtime modeling.

### Existing Result Inspection Loop

Use this when a local command, CI, or another pipeline has already produced raw Allure results or Allure dump artifacts.

1. Locate local raw Allure results or download retained result/dump artifacts before parsing logs or generated HTML reports.
2. Confirm `allure agent inspect` and its input/output flags through `agent capabilities --json` and project-wrapper help.
3. Pass result directories or globs positionally, and pass dump archives with repeated `--dump <archive-or-glob>`.
4. Choose a report mode by audience: `--report off` for intermediate agent-only inspection, and `--report auto`, `awesome`, or `config` for a final user-reviewable pass.
5. Run the supported inspect command with fresh agent output.
6. Print the inspected output's `index.md` path.
7. Review `index.md`, manifests, findings, and relevant per-test markdown before raw logs, generated reports, or source code.
8. If an HTML report is needed, check `manifest/human-report.json` before regenerating anything.
9. Keep shard, matrix, retry, artifact-retention, and non-gating limits explicit.
10. If inspect support or artifact shape is unavailable, try the generated agent-only config fallback with `allure generate --config <generated-config> --output <agent-output>` before dropping to raw Allure files, `allure log <allure-results>`, or logs.
11. If only raw/log inspection is possible, state the weaker evidence path.

### Test Authoring Loop

1. Understand the feature, issue, expected behavior, and risk.
2. Read the `allure-agent-mode` skill's test-design guidance when available.
3. Create the smallest meaningful expectations for the intended scope when they reduce a real validation risk.
4. Write or update focused tests without weakening useful coverage.
5. Run the intended scope through agent mode.
6. Review scope, checks, evidence, and execution signal before claiming validation.
7. Enrich tests when evidence is weak, then rerun with fresh agent output.

### Evidence And Metadata Enrichment Loop

Use this when tests pass but are hard to review:

1. Identify weak evidence, missing checks, missing setup state, missing artifacts, or noisy metadata.
2. Prefer framework integrations and helper-boundary instrumentation over wrapping every line.
3. Add useful steps, attachments, parameters, descriptions, labels, or links using project conventions, keeping per-test intent metadata inline with each test.
4. Redact sensitive values while preserving useful artifact shape.
5. Rerun the same intended scope and report evidence changes.

### Coverage Review Loop

1. Split broad audits into scoped groups when practical.
2. Ensure each group has distinct agent output and use expectations only when the group has a known scope or supports a validation conclusion. Use explicit `--output` paths only when useful for organizing groups.
3. Run each group through agent mode.
4. Separate observed runtime coverage from inferred source-code coverage.
5. Mark review incomplete until every scoped group was validated through matched expectations, reviewed observed scope, or documented as a broad package-health audit.

### Failure Triage And Rerun Loop

Use this when a run reports failed, broken, or flaky tests.

1. Get the run output (`allure agent latest` when the run used the default temp directory) and read `index.md`, `manifest/findings.jsonl`, and the failing per-test markdown before touching source.
2. When a runner-visible failure is missing from `manifest/tests.jsonl`, inspect `artifacts/global/` (for example `stderr`) and treat the run as a partial runtime review.
3. Classify each failure before editing: product bug, stale test, wrong expectation, fixture/environment problem, or flake. Follow the test-design rules; do not weaken assertions or skip tests just to make the run pass.
4. Rerun the narrowest scope through agent mode with fresh output, using the local rerun controls from the Capability Snapshot (such as `--rerun-latest` or `--rerun-from <dir>` with the failed preset) rather than rebuilding runner-specific test names by hand.
5. Re-review the new output and keep shard, retry, flake, and non-gating limits explicit before calling the failure resolved.

## Runtime Artifact Review

After each agent-mode run:

- open the agent-output directory's `AGENTS.md` guide first; it carries the reading order, directory contract, and command map for that run
- read `manifest/run.json` (the canonical run summary), then `manifest/test-events.jsonl`
- read `index.md` for the triage overview, and print its path so collaborators can open it
- read `manifest/tests.jsonl` and `manifest/findings.jsonl`
- read `manifest/expected.json` when the run used expectations, to confirm the contracted scope resolved as intended
- read relevant per-test markdown before inspecting source
- inspect global stderr/log artifacts when runner-visible failures are not represented as logical tests
- for inspected existing results or dumps, use generated agent output before generated reports or raw logs

## Output, State, And Reruns

Do not create persistent agent output or expectation paths. Modern `allure agent` creates and prints a temp output directory when no output is provided; use that default unless a specific path is needed. In `allure@3.12.0` and newer, each `allure agent` run removes the previous run's CLI-provided temp output automatically. Prefer `--output` for explicit paths only when the project needs them; an explicit `--output` path is the one thing the agent must clean up itself — remove or archive it when done. The framework's `allure-results` is separate; clearing it between runs is unnecessary (agent mode detects only the current run's new results), so leave that to project preference.

Allure results paths such as `<parent>/allure-results` are separate reporting configuration and may be stable project paths. Do not use framework result variables such as `ALLURE_RESULTS_DIR` as agent-output controls; document them only when the local adapter requires them and the exact variable is confirmed, and keep the final directory name `allure-results` when the results must be discovered by Allure.

- Agent output policy: `<CLI-provided temp dir / explicit --output convention / unknown>`
- Agent output cleanup: `<CLI-managed for default output / caller-managed for explicit --output / unknown>`
- Latest output recovery: `<supported command or unknown>`
- State directory override: `<supported env var or unknown>`
- Rerun from latest/prior output: `<supported command or unknown>`
- Selection/test plan support: `<supported command/path or unknown>`
- Inspect existing results/dumps: `<supported command/input syntax, unsupported, or unknown>`
- HTML report output: `<auto/off/awesome/config support, default threshold source, manifest path, intermediate/final mode convention, unsupported, or unknown>`
- Generate-with-agent-plugin fallback: `<supported generated config, command syntax, and caller-managed output cleanup, unsupported, or unknown>`
- Non-agent result inspection fallback: `<supported command/input syntax, unsupported, or unknown>`
- Parallel-run rule: each concurrent run must pass its own caller-managed `--output` directory — the default temp output is unsafe for concurrency because each run clears the previous run's temp output — and output paths and expectation state must never be shared
- CI artifact retention: `<raw Allure results, Allure dumps, agent output, logs, traces, none, or unknown>`

## Project Metadata Conventions

Fill only conventions that exist in this project.

Per-test metadata belongs inline with the test. Do not centralize descriptions, labels, links, parameters, or intent-defining step names in helper wrappers, lookup tables, or mappings keyed by test name. Reusable helpers may handle mechanics only; test intent should stay explicit at each test site.

- Feature/story/component/service labels: `<fill or unknown>`
- Owner/team metadata: `<fill or unknown>`
- Severity or priority metadata: `<fill or unknown>`
- Issue, bug, requirement, or known-defect links: `<fill or unknown>`
- Suite/package/module taxonomy: `<fill or unknown>`
- Parameter naming and dynamic-history exclusions: `<fill or unknown>`
- Metadata to avoid: `<decorative labels, unused taxonomy, or unknown>`

## Project Evidence Conventions

Fill only conventions that exist in this project.

- Test descriptions: `<expected style or unknown>`
- Attachments: `<HTTP exchange/image diff/Playwright trace/logs/SQL/fixture conventions or unknown>`
- Step naming: `<project style or unknown>`
- Check/assertion step naming: `<e.g. "expect <actual> to <matcher>", "validate <contract>", or unknown>`
- Assertion/check visibility: `<integration support, documented step-name convention, or unknown>`
- Fixture/setup evidence: `<file tree/database rows/config/logs or unknown>`
- Sensitive data redaction: `<project policy or unknown>`

## Acceptance Rules

Accept a run only when:

- observed scope matches the intended scope, or drift is explained
- coverage remains meaningful for the stated conclusion
- important checks are visible through supported reporting, documented step-name conventions, or source review covers the gap
- evidence is strong enough to explain what happened
- execution-signal limits are explicit
- no high-confidence placeholder or noop evidence findings remain
- partial runtime modeling is called out

When raw local or CI Allure results or dumps are available and `allure agent inspect` support is confirmed, prefer inspected agent output over parsing raw logs or generated HTML reports.

For final user-facing runs, include the generated report link when `manifest/human-report.json` reports `generated`; otherwise state the manifest status if a report was expected. Resolve relative manifest paths, such as `awesome/index.html`, against the agent output directory before presenting them. Call the artifact simply the report and do not wrap it in inline code or a code block; say `Here is the report: <link>` with a normal Markdown link to the absolute local report file so clients can make it clickable or previewable.

If agent output is absent or incomplete, fix that first; do not silently accept console-only conclusions. Fall back to console only when agent mode is genuinely impossible, and then name the blocker and mark the conclusion provisional.
