# Phase 6: Check Implementation

Compare implementation against `docs/ai/design/feature-{name}.md` and `docs/ai/requirements/feature-{name}.md`.

1. **Gather context** — feature description, modified files, relevant design/requirements docs, constraints.
2. **Summarize design** — key decisions, components, interfaces, data flows.
3. **File-by-file comparison** — verify design intent, note deviations, flag logic gaps/edge cases/security issues, identify missing tests or doc updates.
4. **Summarize** alignment status, deviations (with severity), missing pieces, concerns, next steps.

**Next**: Phase 7 (Write Tests) → Phase 8 (Code Review). If major deviations → back to Phase 3 (design wrong) or Phase 4 (implementation wrong).
