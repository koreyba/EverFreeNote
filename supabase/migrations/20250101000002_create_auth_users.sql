-- Test users should be created via Supabase Dashboard or seed.sql
-- Not via migrations to avoid crypto function compatibility issues
-- with hosted Supabase instances

-- Note: auth.identities will be created automatically by Supabase Auth
-- when users first sign in. No need to manually create them in migrations.
