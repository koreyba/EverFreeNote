# Phase 2: Review Requirements

Review `docs/ai/requirements/feature-{name}.md` against the `README.md` template.

1. **Search memory** for relevant conventions or past patterns.
2. **Review** each section: problem statement, goals/non-goals, success criteria, user stories, constraints, open questions, template compliance.
3. **Ask clarification questions** for every gap, contradiction, or ambiguity. Do not just list issues — actively ask specific questions to resolve them. Example: "Success criteria say 'fast' — what's the target latency?"
4. **Update** the requirements doc with clarified answers.
5. **Store** clarifications in memory.
6. **Summarize** what was validated, what was updated, remaining open items.

**Next**: Phase 3 (Review Design). If fundamental gaps remain unresolvable → back to Phase 1.
